Blender Add-on for Stonehearth

This add-on was created by Voxel_Pirate (probably https://github.com/VoxelPirate):

https://forum.minddesk.com/t/blender-add-on-example-based-on-stonehearth/40

I've set up this repository so that I can add more functionality to it (e.g.: scale support), since it's not uploaded to any Github account (that I know of). That way it can also be a centralized place to download it.

It's under GNU GPL license.

For instructions on how to use it, check https://stonehearth.github.io/modding_guide/modding_guide/basic/art/vfx/animations/index.html#BlenderSetup
